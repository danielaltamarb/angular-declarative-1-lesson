Lesson about learning to write code more declarative and reactively.

#What is declarative code
Declarative code in Angular is a way of writing code that describes what a component should do, rather than how it should do it. This means that instead of providing a set of instructions on how to change the state of a component, the code simply states what the component should look like and how it should behave based on the environment. For example, instead of saying "if a car is a firetruck, paint it red", the code would say "firetrucks are red". This approach makes it easier to understand and manage the behavior of a component, especially as it becomes more complex. In Angular, this approach is often used by utilizing data bindings, event handling, and the Observable model.
